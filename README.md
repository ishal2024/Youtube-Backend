The Key Points of this Project

1. Backend Roadmap & Project Overview
   Introduces a complete backend roadmap using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. 
   Builds a video-hosting app (similar to YouTube) featuring signup/login, video uploads, likes/dislikes, comments, replies, subscriptions, etc. 

2. Authentication & Security
   Implements user registration & login with bcrypt (for hashing) and JWT (for access & refresh tokens).
   Covers token lifecycle: issuing, verifying, refreshing access tokens.

3. Express Setup & Routing
  Sets up a robust Express server with modular routes and controllers.
  Teaches clean folder structure: separating routes, controllers, middleware, models, and utilities.

4. Database Design (MongoDB + Mongoose)
   Defines schemas for users, videos, comments, likes, subscriptions, etc.
   Implements CRUD operations and relational population patterns via Mongoose.

5. Middleware & Error Handling
   Custom middleware for authentication (protecting routes) and centralized error handling.
   Wraps asynchronous controller functions to intercept errors gracefully.
   Customizes API responses and standardized error formats. 

6. Feature Implementation
   Video Uploads: Integrates file storage (local/cloud via Cloudinary).
   Engagement Features: Likes/dislikes, commenting with nested replies.
   Subscriptions: Follow/unfollow channels with subscriber count.
   Fetching Feeds: Videos sorted by subscription or trending.

7. Standard API Practices
   Emphasizes RESTful API design: endpoints, HTTP verbs, status codes.
   Implements pagination, filtering, and search endpoints for scalability.

9. Security Enhancements
   Discusses best practices: secure HTTP headers, rate limiting, sensitive config via environment vars.
   Introduces refresh token logic and logout/blacklist flows.
